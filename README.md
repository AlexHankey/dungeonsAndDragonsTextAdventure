# Dungeons and Dragons Text Adventure

Welcome adventurer 

## Installation

Install golang 
https://go.dev/doc/install

Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.
The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
```bash
$ go version
```
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.

## Project Setup & Run 

Now navigate to where you build your projects, for me this is ~/Users/username/go/src/github.com/username/ and make a folder.

```bash
cd ~/Users/username/go/src/github.com/username/
mkdir goDnd
cd goDnd
```
Clone this project, then in the terminal run:
```bash
go run main.go
```
