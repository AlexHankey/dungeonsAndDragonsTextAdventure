Welcome adventurer 

## Installation

Install golang

Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.
The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
```bash
$ go version
```
Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
